For the Optical Sensor the absolute maximum current that the optical sensor can handle would be 200mA. However, this is for a specific mode where the proximity sensor and gesture control are active. Since I am utilizing the opticcal sensor solely for detecting the brightest light source, I would need a max of 0.3mA for the sensor to function properly. This leaves plenty of room for improvements and future proofing for later use.
