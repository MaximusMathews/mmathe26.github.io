# Decision Process

I removed several sensors due to time constraints and some issues with the voltage sensor. Furthermore, the optical sensors were upgraded to thier daughter board versions to futher help with the time constraints. This block diagram meets our product requirement as it incorporates aspects of serial communication and helps inspire STEAM based innovation for K-12 students.
